        <h2>Systemic Circulation of the Human Heart</h2>
        <p>Systemic circulation is the part of the cardiovascular system that carries oxygenated blood from the heart to
            the
            body and returns deoxygenated blood back to the heart. This process supplies oxygen and nutrients to the
            tissues
            and organs, while removing waste products like carbon dioxide.</p>

        <h2>Here’s a detailed explanation of systemic circulation:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Oxygenated Blood Leaves the Heart:</h3>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>After blood becomes oxygenated in the lungs during pulmonary circulation, it returns to the left
                    atrium
                    of the
                    heart via the pulmonary veins.</li>
                <li>The left atrium contracts, pushing the oxygen-rich blood through the mitral valve into the left
                    ventricle.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>
                <h3>Blood is Pumped to the Body:</h3>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>When the left ventricle contracts, it pumps the oxygenated blood through the aortic valve into the
                    aorta, the
                    largest artery in the body.</li>
                <li>The aorta branches into smaller arteries, which distribute the oxygen-rich blood throughout the
                    body,
                    supplying
                    all organs, tissues, and cells.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>
                <h3>Oxygen is Delivered to the Tissues:</h3>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The oxygen-rich blood flows through the arteries, which gradually branch into smaller arterioles and
                    eventually
                    into tiny capillaries.</li>
                <li>Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels and are where oxygen and nutrients are exchanged for
                    carbon
                    dioxide
                    and waste products in the body’s tissues.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>
                <h3>Deoxygenated Blood Returns to the Heart:</h3>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the blood has delivered oxygen and collected carbon dioxide and waste products, it becomes
                    deoxygenated.</li>
                <li>The deoxygenated blood from the capillaries is collected by venules, which join to form veins. These
                    veins carry
                    the blood back to the heart.</li>

                <li>Two large veins, the superior vena cava (bringing blood from the upper body) and the inferior vena
                    cava
                    (bringing
                    blood from the lower body), return the deoxygenated blood to the right atrium of the heart.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>
                <h3>The Cycle Continues:</h3>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>From the right atrium, the blood flows through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, where
                    it
                    will begin
                    pulmonary circulation again, heading to the lungs for oxygenation.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <h1>Key Points of Systemic Circulation:</h1>
        <h3>Aorta: </h3>The main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the body.
        <h3>Arteries and Capillaries:</h3> Distribute oxygen and nutrients to the tissues.
        <h3>Veins (Superior and Inferior Vena Cava):</h3> Return deoxygenated blood back to the heart.
        Systemic circulation ensures that all the body’s cells receive oxygen and nutrients and that waste products
            are removed efficiently.

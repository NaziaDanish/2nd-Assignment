    <p class="leftatrium">The right atrium is one of the four chambers of the human heart, playing a crucial role in the circulation
        of deoxygenated blood. Located in the upper-right section of the heart, it receives oxygen-poor blood from
        the body through two major veins: the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava. Once the right atrium
        fills with blood, it contracts, pushing the blood through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle.
        This process is vital for ensuring that blood flows efficiently into the right ventricle, which then pumps
        it to the lungs for oxygenation. The right atrium is also home to the sinoatrial (SA) node, often referred
        to as the heart's natural pacemaker, which regulates the heart’s rhythm by initiating electrical impulses
        that coordinate the heartbeat</p>

    <p class="leftatrium">The right atrium plays a key role in the heart's function as part of the circulatory system. Its main
        purpose is to receive deoxygenated blood from the body and pass it to the right ventricle, which then
        sends it to the lungs for oxygenation. </p>

    <h3>Here’s a breakdown of how the right atrium works:</h3>
    <h2 id="h1left">Working of the Right Atrium:</h2>
<nav>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Receiving Deoxygenated Blood:</h3>
            Superior Vena Cava: Brings blood from the upper body (head, neck, and arms).
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Inferior Vena Cava:</h3> Brings blood from the lower body (abdomen, legs, etc.).
            Additionally, the coronary sinus drains deoxygenated blood from the heart muscles into the right atrium.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Holding Blood:</h3>
            As the blood fills the right atrium, it stretches to accommodate the volume, acting as a temporary
            reservoir.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Atrial Contraction:</h3>
            Once filled, the right atrium contracts, which is triggered by the heart's electrical conduction system.
            The contraction pushes the blood through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Blood Flow Regulation:</h3>
            The tricuspid valve between the right atrium and right ventricle ensures that blood flows in the correct
            direction and prevents backflow during the contraction of the right ventricle.
        </li>
    </ol>
</nav>


    <h2 id="h1left">Summary of Blood Flow through the Right Atrium:</h2>
    <nav>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 1:</h3> Blood returns from the body to the right atrium.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 2:</h3> The right atrium fills with deoxygenated blood.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 3:</h3> The atrium contracts, pushing blood through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 4:</h3> The blood then moves from the right ventricle to the lungs for oxygenation.
            In this way, the right atrium is critical for ensuring that blood is properly circulated from the body
            to the lungs, allowing the heart to maintain efficient circulation.

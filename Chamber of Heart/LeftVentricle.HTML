    <h1 id="h1left">Left Ventricle</h1>
    <p class="leftatrium"> The right ventricle is a vital chamber of the heart, responsible for pumping deoxygenated
        blood to the lungs
        for oxygenation. It works as part of the pulmonary circulation system and is essential for maintaining the
        flow of blood through the heart and lungs.</p>

    <h2 id="h1left">Working of the Right Ventricle:</h2>


    <h2 id="h1left">Receiving Blood:</h2>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li>After the right atrium contracts, it pushes deoxygenated blood through the tricuspid valve into the
                right .
                The tricuspid valve ensures that the blood flows in the right direction and prevents backflow into
                the
                right
                atrium.
            </li>


            <h2 id="h1left">Holding Blood:</h2>
            <li>The right ventricle holds the deoxygenated blood briefly until
                it contracts. The ventricular walls
                are
                muscular
                and thicker than the atriumâ€™s walls, as the right ventricle must generate enough force to pump blood
                to
                the
                lungs.
            </li>


            <h2 id="h1left">Contraction and Ejection:</h2>
            <li>When the right ventricle contracts (during systole), the blood is forced out through the pulmonary
                valve
                into the
                pulmonary artery, which transports it to the lungs.
            </li>

            <li>The pulmonary valve ensures that blood does not flow back into the right ventricle after it
                contracts.
            </li>
    </nav>


    <h2 id="h1left">Pumping to the Lungs:</h2>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The right ventricle pumps the deoxygenated blood into the pulmonary artery, which leads to the
                lungs. In the
                lungs,
                the blood picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide, completing the pulmonary circuit.
            </li>


            <h2 id="h1left">Resting Phase:</h2>
            <li>fter the contraction, the right ventricle relaxes (during diastole) and the cycle repeats, with
                more
                blood
                entering from the right atrium.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

    <h2 id="h1left">Resting Phase:</h2>
    <h3>Summary of Blood Flow through the Right Ventricle:</h3>

    <nav>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Step 1:</b> Blood enters the right ventricle from the right atrium via the tricuspid valve.</li>
            <li><b>Step 2:</b> The right ventricle contracts and pumps blood through the pulmonary valve.</li>
            <li><b>Step 3:</b> Blood flows into the pulmonary artery and heads to the lungs for oxygenation.</li>
        </ol>
    </nav>

    <h3>Importance:</h3>
    <p class="leftatrium">The right ventricle plays a critical role in maintaining pulmonary circulation by ensuring
        that deoxygenated
        blood
        reaches the lungs to become oxygenated. Its proper functioning is vital for oxygenating the blood and sustaining
        life.</p>

    <h1 id="h1left">Right Ventrical</h1>

    <p class="leftatrium">The right ventricle is one of the four chambers of the heart. Its primary role is to pump deoxygenated blood
      to the lungs, where it can pick up oxygen and release carbon dioxide. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its
      structure, function, and working process:</p>

</div>

  <h2 id="h1left"> Anatomy of the Right Ventricle</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Location:
      <ul>

        <li> The right ventricle is located on the right side of the heart, just below the right atrium. The heart has
          four chambers: the right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle. The right ventricle is the
          chamber responsible for receiving blood from the right atrium and pumping it to the lungs.</li>


        <h2 id="h1left"> Shape and Structure:</h2>

        <li>It is triangular in shape and relatively thinner than the left ventricle because it only needs to pump
          blood to the lungs, which are close to the heart, whereas the left ventricle pumps blood throughout the
          body.</li>

        <h2 id="h1left">Important Valves:</h2>

        <li> Tricuspid Valve: Located between the right atrium and the right ventricle. It ensures that blood flows
          in one direction—from the atrium to the ventricle—without backflow.</li>

        <h2 id="h1left">ulmonary Valve: </h2>

        <li>Located at the exit of the right ventricle where it connects to the pulmonary artery. This valve
          ensures blood moves from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery (toward the lungs)
          flowing back into the heart.</li>

        <h2 id="h1left">Function of the Right Ventricle.</h2>

        <p class="leftatrium">The right ventricle works as part of the pulmonary circulation system, which is responsible for
          transporting blood to and from the lungs for gas exchange.</p>

        <h2 id="h1left">The process involves the following steps:</h2>

        <h2 id="h1left">1. Blood Reception from the Right Atrium</h3>

        <li> Deoxygenated blood (blood low in oxygen and high in carbon dioxide) enters the right atrium from the
          superior and inferior vena cava. The tricuspid valve opens, allowing blood to flow into the right ventricle
          as it relaxes.</li>

        <h2 id="h1left"> 2. Right Ventricle Filling</h2>

        <li>The right ventricle fills with deoxygenated blood. The filling happens during the relaxation phase of
          the heart (diastole).Once the right ventricle is filled, the tricuspid valve closes to prevent
          backflow into the atrium.</li>

        <h2 id="h1left">3. Contraction and Pumping to the Lungs</h2>

        <li> When the right ventricle contracts (during systole), it pumps blood through the pulmonary valve into
          the pulmonary artery. This artery transports the deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation.</li>

        <h2 id="h1left"> 4. Gas Exchange in the Lungs</h2>

        <li>In the lungs, blood passes through capillaries surrounding the alveoli (tiny air sacs). Here, it releases
          carbon dioxide (which is exhaled) and picks up oxygen (which will be delivered to the body).</li>

        <h2 id="h1left">5. Pulmonary Circulation Continues</h2>

        <li> being oxygenated, blood leaves the lungs and returns to the left atrium of the heart via the pulmonary
          veins. The left side of the heart (left atrium and left ventricle) then pumps this oxygen-rich blood
          the rest of the body.
    </li>


  </ul>

    <h2 id="h1left">Clinical Importance of the Right Ventricle</h2>
    <li>Pulmonary Hypertension: Increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries can cause the right ventricle to work
    harder, leading to hypertrophy (thickening of the heart muscle), and eventually heart failure if untreated.</li>

  <li>
    <h2 id="h1left">Right Ventricular Failure: </h2>If the right ventricle is weakened, it can lead to right-sided heart failure,
    the heart is unable to effectively pump blood to the lungs. This can cause symptoms such as swelling in the
    legs, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>Congenital Heart Defects:</h2>Conditions like Tetralogy of Fallot involve structural abnormalities of the right
    ventricle and its connection to the pulmonary artery, which can interfere with the blood flow to the lungs.
  </li>
</ul>

  <h2 id="h1left"> Working the Right Ventricle’s Role</h2>
  <P class="leftatrium">The right ventricle pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs via the pulmonary artery.
    It receives blood from the right atrium, contracts, and sends blood to the lungs, where it becomes
    oxygenated.</P>
  <P class="leftatrium">The right ventricle works in coordination with the left side of the heart to maintain effective blood
    circulation in the body.
    Efficient right ventricular function is essential for maintaining adequate oxygen levels in the blood and
    for overall heart health.
